    "High-Frequency Trading (HFT) refers to rapid electronic trade in financial instruments. **Trading venues make current pricing information available as continuous streams of electronic data**. Traders monitor these streams, reconstructing pricing and demand for relevant stocks, options, futures and currencies to determine when and what to trade. Buy/Sell orders are then sent to the exchange as soon as possible. Algorithms take advantage of fleeting variations in stock price or demand over time or between different exchanges, accumulating profit by making tiny gains on large numbers of transactions.\n",
